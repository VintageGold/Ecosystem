# Notes  
goals for dynamic caching layer (and semantics)


1. dynamic reading
2. dynamic writing
3. formal verification
-knowing what the primitives of the bytecode are 
-defining what should and should not happen


this solves major problem for DAOstack: essential to a fluid dao ecosystem, and good UX


to get to Governance Component U.I. Library we need to write a dynamic caching layer


finish a spec by Aracon?


This would allow devs to:
1. write the contract
2. map their contracts to semantic definitions (that already exists on IPFS)
-then people understand how to use your contract based on this definition
-reading data and displaying it to a user in an understandable way
-everything maps back to this shared semantics 


we want a markup language that defines:
1. function
2. inputs
3. sub-functions


a way to describe an EVM function in modular, formally verified chunks


make this the core of our timeline!
