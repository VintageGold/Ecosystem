# dOrg (The Decentralized Organization dApp)  
## Goal  
Provide tools and services that enable the use of DAOs for all.  

## Plan  
Start with software development, cater to a specific group, gain traction there, move outward and enable other communities after. Think of a group of journalists, or film makers.  

Please see our ["Key Scenarios"](./key-scenarios.md) document where we will document the user scenarios we will be developing solutions for.

## dOrg?  
We wanted something that was easy for anyone, inside or outside the blockchain community, to remember and become familiar with. We think that the term dApp was extremely successful in doing this for Decentralized Apps, which brought us to thinking dOrg for Decentralized Organizations was a good fit.  

The term DAO has become a standard in the blockchain community, and we do not aim to replace. We plan to use the term DAO in all technical documentation, and will only use dOrg as an up front "new user friendly" term.
