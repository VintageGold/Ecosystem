# dOrg (The Decentralized Organization dApp)  
## Goal  
To enable the next generation of software development (existing orgs, open source, new projects / teams).  

## Plan  
Start with software development, cater to a specific group, gain traction there, move outward and enable other communities after. Think of a group of journalists, or film makers.  

## Feature Areas  
- Development  
  - Repo [GitHub & GitLabs first, future goal to go decentralized]  
  - Automated builds and publishing steps.  
- Project Management [tasks, priority]  
  - Tasks  
  - Priority  
  - Reputation  
  - Hook: communication, finances, legal  
- Finance  
  - CLOSED LOOP  
  - Payroll  
  - Funding  
  - Dividends % Ownership  
  - Revenue Stream  
- Community  
  - Personal Profiles [reputation]  
  - Activity Feeds  
  - Chat [adhoc, community, instant access]  
  - Forums [cataloged discussion for specific thing] [comments on a task?]  
- Legal  
  - Catch all for things not facilitated on chain. Cannot call into question the on chain process’ and override their existing nature.  
  - Documents  
  - Courts  
  - RL Jurisdiction  

## Scenarios  
- See project on GitHub, click on button, buy some shares (if open to investment).  
- Starting a new company (kickstarter ish).  
- Established companies that want to create edge developments. Fund development.  
- [Dividend] Verify the dividend stream (app to smart contract).  
  - Verification (automated) to protect against fraud.  
  - Company’s main address, easy.  
  - They ship on our standard platform, easier for developer.  
  - Closing the loop (stake holders, DAO, source code, income stream, back to dao & holders).  
- Insight into your company’s different stats: revenue stream, investment distribution, development activity.  
- Automated & decentralized environment, ENS pointing to it.  

## Tech  
- Project Management: Colony, DAOStack, Aragon  
- Finance: OpenZeppelin  
- Community: Status, UPort  
- Legal: Aragon  

## dOrg?  
The term DAO is often only associated with "The DAO" hack. We also don't want to be vague. By simply saying "Decentralized Organization" it is self discriptive and simple to understand. Shortening those two words gives you "dOrg".
