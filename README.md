# Welcome

dOrg is a web3 freelancer coalition. We join forces to enjoy economies of scale while maintaining our independence as freelancers.

See our [Handbook](TODO) to learn all about the organization.

# Bounties

The easiest way for a new freelancer to start earning Rep in dOrg is to complete an open bounty. If the DAO accepts your bounty, you will receive up to the full reward along with the corresponding Reputation in the DAO!

See the `Issues` section of the repository for all open bounties.

### Bounty Curation

Anyone can add a bounty and (optionally) propose funding. Bounties are funded by the DAO through a proposal of intent. Links to these passed proposals will be added to each bounty.
