# dOrg Setup and Configuration  
## Description  
As a creator of a dOrg, I need to be able to setup and configure it to my liking.  

## Motivation  
We'd like to make the process of standing up a global organization extremely easy. The newly created dOrg shouldn't feel foreign to the creator. They should have a good idea of what this dOrg could look like in the future as more members join and new developments take place. The configuration of the dOrg should be heavily based on the creator's aspirations, and in line with the future of the dOrg. We should be able to provide guidance in the form of: education material, real world data, contacts who can help, and templates.  

## Examples

TODO: Bill is looking for ways to grow and accelerate so his team can take on larger projects for new clients...  
### Jill: Creator of a growing open source project.  
TODO: Jill is looking to financially sustain future development without sacrificing her project's sovereignty. She also wants to incentivize new contributors... She's also looking for a way to collaborate with larger organizations that want to take a dependency on her project, and want to influence development...  
### A-Team: A group of artists that met online, and want to collaborate on a show.  
TODO: The A-Team is a group of 2D animators that met in a subreddit. They have an idea for a new web series that they want to create...
