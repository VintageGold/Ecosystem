# Reduce Conversational Noise
## Description  
The chat should be a place for "chatting" and not a source of information. All chatting that results in any real progress should be captured elsewhere.

Therefore, we propose a solution where the chat history only is retained for two days.

## Motivation  
One of the things that DAO's enables is the collaboration of a large number of people - see for instance with DAOstac's Holographic consensus. Therefore, also the tools for communications needs the ability to scale.

Chats are unstructured and often consist of a lot of noise, and the problem grows larger and larger the more people that enter a chat. In the end, only the most dedicated users manage to follow the chat.

People should not be required to read through a long and potentially noisy chat log to see what's going on in a DAO.

## Examples  
TODO: Show a few different examples of what this scenario might look like.  

## Supporting Data  
TODO: Show supporting data to help explain: why this scenario is important, what this scenario is trying to solve, who this scenario is mainly for.  

## Implementation Plan  
TODO: Explain how we might go about implementing this. This section can be under heavy iteration, and should be maintained as the scenario comes online.
