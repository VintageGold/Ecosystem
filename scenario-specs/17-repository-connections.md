# Repository Connections  
## Description  
Make it possible for the DAO to own a decentralized Git repository. The merging of PRs and other repository management should be managed through the DAO.

It should also be possible to mirror the repository to centralized services like GitHub and Bitbucket, but the ultimate source of through should be decided through consensus, through the DAO.
## Motivation  
The work created (code etc.) should not be in the hands of a single person. It should be owned collectively and managed collectively through the DAO.

## Example Scenarios  
TODO: Show a few different examples of what this scenario might look like.  

## Supporting Data  
TODO: Show supporting data to help explain: why this scenario is important, what this scenario is trying to solve, who this scenario is mainly for.  

## Implementation Plan  
TODO: Explain how we might go about implementing this. This section can be under heavy iteration, and should be maintained as the scenario comes online.
