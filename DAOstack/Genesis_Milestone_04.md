  - The key improvements of DAOcreaor V1 are related to *usability*
    
    - **Simple by Default**: Open the app and launch a DAO in under 1 minute
    
    - **Advanced Mode**: All  configuration options are still easily accessible for advanced users
    
    - **Educational On-boarding**:Learn how DAOstack works as you click through the tooltips
    
    - **1 Member DAOs**: User is included as the DAO's first member by default. No more opening metamask to copy & paste.
