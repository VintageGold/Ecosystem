## User Story

### Current

  DAOs does not have any way to interact with their ENS domains (if they have) - Or the ability to create an ENS (after ENS plugin has been added)

### New 

  User can go to a section of "ENS Dashboard" in DAO, where he can manage all the domains that are owned by the organization, if he wants to make a change it will need to go through a proposal on ENS plugin.

  If the ENS Dashboard is not added, there will be a button on this section that will create the proposal in scheme manager to add this new scheme

## Detailed Design

  We want to interact with the ENS contracts, so the DAO can registrer/edit/renew it's domains by interacting with the ENS contracts.
