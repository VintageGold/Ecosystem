# Biz Dev

- Simplify & standardize dOrg's DAOstack service offering
	- Set pricing for Essentials + Add-ons:
		- *Essentials* = Configure the necessary Generic Actions & deploy with Rep whitelist
		- *Bootstrap Solution* = Rep bootstrap app custom styling & parameterization for token lock, bid and snapshot
		- *On-boarding & Engagement* = Stakeholder on-boarding, proposal priming, user feedback, social media campaign, content creation
		- *Custom Governance UI* = Customized governance app that can be embedded in the client's own site
	- This can serve as our plan of attack for attracting DeFi projects to DAOstack
	- Currently testing this out with a few potential clients ([NecDAO](../NecDAO/DAOify_NecDAO.pdf), Bancor, Totle, Orchid)

- Develop tailored offering for large institutions (non-profits, NGOs, corporates) to run DAOstack pilots
	- Slush fund for their employees
	- Standard pricing for set-up
	- Seed everyone with ETH & GEN for participation
	- Set up (monthly) contribution drip contract for the institution

- Develop plan of attack for DAOstack adoption among SMEs (agencies, consulting shops, worker co-op)
	- We already have real interest from several companies on this front
	- Make it way easier for them to try out DAOstack through
		- On-boarding workshops & facilitated weekly calls
		- 1-page guide on practical operational questions (budgeting, legal, bookkeeping)
